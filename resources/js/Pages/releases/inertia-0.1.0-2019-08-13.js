      So yes, to answer your question, Inertia.js is now safe to use in production. ðŸŽ‰ Of course, we're still working
      toward a 1.0 release, and the API is subject to change. However, you can now lock in your dependency versions and
      use the library safely.
    </P>
    <P>
      You'll need to update your applications. Please review the instructions below. You can also see an example of this
      update on the Ping CRM demo app{' '}
      <A href="https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm/commit/14352710ad577e45062a49d19a6a6d441e958fb6">here</A>.
    </P>
    <H2>1. Update your JavaScript dependencies</H2>
    <P>First, you'll need to update your existing dependency to use the new NPM package name:</P>
    <Ul>
      <Li>
        <Code>inertia/inertia-vue</Code> becomes <Code>@inertiajs/inertia-vue</Code>
      </Li>
      <Li>
        <Code>inertia/inertia-react</Code> becomes <Code>@inertiajs/inertia-react</Code>
      </Li>
    </Ul>
    <P>
      Be sure to lock these in at <Code>^0.1.0</Code>. For example:
    </P>
    <CodeBlock
      language="js"
      children={dedent`
        "@inertiajs/inertia-vue": "^0.1.0",
      `}
    />
    <P>
      Second, you need to add <Code>@inertiajs/inertia</Code> as a dependency as well. It's no longer automatically
      included with the adapters.
    </P>
    <CodeBlock
      language="sh"
      children={dedent`
        npm install @inertiajs/inertia
      `}
    />
    <H2>2. Update your imports</H2>
    <P>We've removed all default exports and are now using named exports.</P>
    <CodeBlock
      language="js"
      children={dedent`
        // Before
        import Inertia from 'inertia-vue'
        import Inertia from 'inertia-react'\n
        // After
        import { InertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue'
        import { InertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-react'
      `}
    />
    <P>If you're using Vue, you'll need to update the plugin:</P>
    <CodeBlock
      language="js"
      children={dedent`
        // Before
        Vue.use(Inertia)\n
        // After
        Vue.use(InertiaApp)
      `}
    />
    <P>If you were previously importing Inertia from one of the adapters, you now need to import that directly.</P>
    <CodeBlock
      language="js"
      children={dedent`
        // Before
        import { Inertia } from 'inertia-vue'
        import { Inertia } from 'inertia-react'\n
        // After
        import { Inertia } from 'inertia'
      `}
    />
    <H2>3. Update your PHP dependencies</H2>
    <P>
      If you are currently using the <Code>inertiajs/inertia-laravel</Code> adapter, be sure to set your version to{' '}
      <Code>^0.1</Code>. This library has now been tagged as well. Note, there were some breaking changes made recently
      to how <Code>Inertia::share()</Code> works.
    </P>
