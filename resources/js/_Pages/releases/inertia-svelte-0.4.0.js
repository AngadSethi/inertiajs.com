- [INTERNAL] Removed `transformProps()` call, since this is now now done in Inertia core.

<H2>Breaking changes</H2>

This release updates the `$page` store to return the full `page` object, instead of just the page `props`. The purpose of this change is to better reflect what the [page object](https://inertiajs.com/the-protocol#the-page-object) is, and to make the other properties within the page object available to you, such as the `url`, `version` and `component` name. The upgrade path here is straightforwardâ€”simply append `.props` to all instances of `$page`.

This release also requires version `0.4.0` of the `@inertiajs/inertia` package. Please be sure to update your dependencies accordingly.

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <>
    </>
  )
}

Page.layout = (page) => <Layout children={page} meta={meta} />

export default Page
