- Updated form helper to automatically remember form data ([#575](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/575)).
- Added new form helper options ([#575](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/575)).
- Updated form helper to ensure `preserveScroll` and `preserveState` callbacks have latest form data ([#410](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/410)).
- Added Cypress test suite ([#395](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/395)).

## Automatic remembering of form data

The form helper now automatically remembers form data and errors. Previously you had to do this manually:

```js
remember: 'form'
```

Doing this automatically is not only easier, but it's also more in line with default browser behaviour.

If you need to disable this behaviour, you can do that using the new `remember` form helper option (see below).

## Form helper options

The form helper now accepts a second "options" argument. This lets you set a form `key`, needed if there are multiple forms on the page. You can also disable the automatic remember behaviour by setting the `remember` option to `false`.

```js
this.$inertia.form({
  email: null,
  password: null,
}, {
  key: 'login',
  remember: false,
})
```

## Form visit callback improvements

This release fixes a tricky, edge case issue with the form helper, where the `preserveState` and `preserveScroll` visit callbacks didn't have access to the updated form state until it was too late.

```js
preserveScroll: () => this.form.hasErrors, // old form values
preserveState: () => this.form.hasErrors,  // old form values
```

The workaround was to use the `page` object passed to these callbacks instead. Unfortunately, this is kind of verbose.

```js
preserveScroll: (page) => Object.keys(page.props.errors).length > 0,
preserveState: (page) => Object.keys(page.props.errors).length > 0,
```

This issue has now been corrected, and you can reference the form helper methods and properties directly within these callbacks without issue.
