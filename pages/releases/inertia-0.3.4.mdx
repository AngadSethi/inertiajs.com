<h1>inertia@v0.3.4</h1>

<div className="-mt-8 mb-12 text-base font-medium text-gray-600">Published on September 24, 2020</div>

- Reverted [0.3.3](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/releases) change that fired a "finish" event if the "start" event was cancelled (dc1a958).
- Added the ability to cancel a visit from the `onStart()` callback (#233).
